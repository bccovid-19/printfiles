## Changes

### Version 4:

- Optimized layer and tool-paths, prints with 0.3mm layers, and 0.72mm line width
- Added ergonomic center design, reduced total material usage
- Changed angle of hooks for less tangling in hair, and better mask retention
- Reduced overall height to improve nesting
- Added step-over to improve layer bonding and create a rounded surface for handling

### Version 3:

 - overall length reduced to fit on smaller print beds
 - hook shape adjusted to improve printability
 - overall height scaled to reduced thickness of strap and hooks (improved flexibility and reduced print time)
