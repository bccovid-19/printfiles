# ES.V4: ear_saver_small_V004.STL

## Recommended print settings

- Material: *PETG is preferred, PLA is acceptable*
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm
- Extrusion width (0.4 mm to 0.6 mm nozzle, preferred): 0.72 mm
- Extrusion width (0.4 mm to 0.6 mm nozzle, alternate): any divisor of 3.5 mm (eg. 0.5 mm, 0.583 mm, 0.7 mm, 0.875 mm)
- Extrusion width (0.8 mm to 1.0 mm nozzle): 1.44 mm
- Initial layer height: !!! This must be 0.3 mm
- Layer height: !!! This must be 0.3 mm
- Infill: N/A - Thin enough that it should print solid
- Walls: 3-4 for extrusion width of 0.72 mm; 2-3 for extrusion width of 1.44 mm; 5 for thinner extrusion widths
- Support: No (N/A)
- Note that these are relatively aggressive print settings, may not work with all printers and will likely require finetuning. Your hotend's maximum volumetric flow (a factor of your extrusion width, layer height, and print speed) will likely determine how fast you can print each ear saver. For most printers, between 3-10 minutes/ear saver is very reasonable. You may need to run your extruder temperature hotter than normal to maintain good flow.
- For anyone new to printing PETG, main points to remember compared to PLA, it needs a hotter extruder temperature (220-260C), hotter build plate (70-100C), and is prone to stringing. Consider enabling "Combing" (print head avoids crossing perimeters) or equivalent, and especially with bowden setups, pay attention to retraction distance, retraction speed, and travel speed.

## Changelog

### Version 4:

- Optimized layer and tool-path, prints with 0.3 mm layer height and 0.72 mm line width
- Added ergonomic centre design, reduced total material usage
- Changed angle of hooks for less tangling in hair, and better mask retention
- Reduced overall height to improve nesting
- Added step-over to improve layer bonding and create a rounded surface for handling

### Version 3:

- Overall length reduced to fit on smaller print beds
- Hook shape adjusted to improve printability
- Overall height scaled to reduce thickness of strap and hooks (improved flexibility and reduced print time)
