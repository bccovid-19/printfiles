# File Selection
The [Entended Visor](./3DVerkstan_RetroLabs_v5_padded_NA_6hole.stl) version is preferred due to the increased forehead clearance and comfort. If your build plate cannot fit this model, then the starndard [0.6mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-0.6mm_chamferred.stl) and  [1mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-1mm_chamferred.stl) are acceptable.

# Standard Visor
The [0.6mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-0.6mm_chamferred.stl) should be tried first, as it has a reduced print time. If this version adheres too much to your print bed and is unable to be removed without damage please switch to the [1mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-1mm_chamferred.stl).

# Extended Visor
The [Entended Visor](./3DVerkstan_RetroLabs_v5_padded_NA_6hole.stl) version can be used for practitioners needing an extended space between the visor and the face to accommodate glasses or goggles. It has been confirmed to work with the same dimensions and hole pattern as the standard version.

# Files for Prusa MK3 and MK3s

Within the `For Prusa MK3 and MK3s` folder you will find two 3mf files. They are the same only one has had the bands flipped to spread the wear on the build platform a bit better.
