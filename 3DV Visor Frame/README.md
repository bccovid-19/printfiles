- [Packaging & Handling](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=sv&tl=en&u=https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-packing-handling/), specific to Sweden, but useful nonetheless.

# Common/Recommended Print Settings (See Print Settings Guide above for further details)
- Material: PETG, PLA acceptable if no other choice
- Nozzle: 0.4 mm
- Extrusion Width (preferred): 0.72 mm
- Layer Height: ~0.3 mm
- Infill: 0%, increase if nubs have holes in them
- Walls: 4, goal is to have solid fill, i.e. the arms should be only filled with perimeters
- Support: No (N/A)

# File Selection
The [Extended Visor](./3DVerkstan_RetroLabs_v5_padded_NA_6hole.stl) version is preferred due to the increased forehead clearance and comfort. If your build plate cannot fit this model, then the standard [0.6mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-0.6mm_chamferred.stl) and  [1mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-1mm_chamferred.stl) are acceptable.

# Standard Visor
The [0.6mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-0.6mm_chamferred.stl) should be tried first, as it has a reduced print time. If this version adheres too much to your print bed and is unable to be removed without damage please switch to the [1mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-1mm_chamferred.stl).

# Extended Visor
The [Extended Visor](./3DVerkstan_RetroLabs_v5_padded_NA_6hole.stl) version can be used for practitioners needing an extended space between the visor and the face to accommodate glasses or goggles. It also increases the width of of the forehead contact surface and permits the use of padding (weatherstripping foam) if desired. It has been confirmed to work with the same dimensions and hole pattern as the standard version.

# Files for Prusa MK3 and MK3s

Within the `For Prusa MK3 and MK3s` folder you will find two .3mf files. These are print profiles of the [Extended Visor](./3DVerkstan_RetroLabs_v5_padded_NA_6hole.stl), with relatively aggressive settings for quick prints. One has had the bands flipped to spread the wear on the build platform a bit better.
