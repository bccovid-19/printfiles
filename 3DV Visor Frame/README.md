The [0.6mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-0.6mm_chamferred.stl) should be tried first, as it has a reduced print time. If this version adheres too much to your print bed and is unable to be removed without damage please switch to the [1mm Version](./Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5-1mm_chamferred.stl)
