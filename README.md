# BC Covid-19 3D Printing Effort #

Hello,

If you are reading this it means you are thinking of helping the COVID-19 fight with your 3D printer. That's great! Please see more information below.

## How to start contributing? ##

The following questions are extracted from the [BC Covid-19 3D Printing Effort Starting Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ttu-DrwoGttRoviB6C2idflY3-9sC5mBmkxYlhFMHls/edit?usp=sharing). This file is being kept up-to-date by our community and you will find the latest information there.

## Who's organizing all this? ##

Currently we are getting organized using the [BC Covid-19 3D Printing Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/bccovid-19/shared_invite/zt-cz01ettu-XZs6dWzob92pDKfFyCusag). There you can find the latest information on our efforts.

## How can I help? ##

- First you should sign up as a supplier using this [form](https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/headset-printers).
- Check the demand for the items [here](https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/total-supply-and-demand?authuser=0).
- Download the `.stl` files in this repo. Those are the files being used by our community.

## Is there a specific item in high demand? ##

Both [Visor Frames](https://github.com/bccovid-19/printfiles/tree/master/3DV%20Visor%20Frame) and [Ear Savers](https://github.com/bccovid-19/printfiles/tree/master/Ear%20Saver) are needed. You can check the current demand for the items [here](https://sites.google.com/view/gvrd-face-shield-printers/home/total-supply-and-demand?authuser=0).

## What 3D printers are required, known to work, or recommended? ##

Visor frames measure 159x193mm so printers must have plates large enough. If your build plate is too small, you may still be able to contribute with the Ear Savers. Beyond this any FDM printer should work.

## Am I required to print with a specific filament type? ##

- For the *Visor Frames*, *PETG is preferred* but PLA is acceptable.
- For the *Ear Saver*, *PLA is preferred*, but PETG will also work.

## Are there any specific slicing configurations needed (layer height, printing speed, etc.)? ##

Please take some time to read [this guide](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-print-guide/), since it has some good information that can even speed up the printing time. Also see the Readme for each model.

## I have a few items printed, what now? ##

Delivery is likely to be handled by a local company, as will most pick-ups (more details expected by April 1st, 2020). We'll ask that each producer withhold the items they've printed for collection when there's a decent amount available, rather than a few at a time.
